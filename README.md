=========

MaLTE is a novel approach to gene and transcript expression prediction that uses a supervised learning approach to achieve performance superior to conventional microarray summarisation. It learns from a gold standard how best to use fluorescent probe intensity values. This leads to more accurate and absolute expression estimates as well as an simple facility to obtain expression estimates for individual transcript isoforms.
